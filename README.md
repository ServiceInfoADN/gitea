# Gitea API Client

This package provides an API client for [Gitea](https://gitea.io) API Version 1.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This package has the following requirements:

* PHP 7.2+

### Installing

Install latest version via composer:

```
composer require adn/gitea
```

### Basic usage

```
// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

// - - - - -

// Create client and authenticate
$giteaClient = new Adn\Gitea\Client(
    'https://gitea.yourdomain.com',
    [
        'type' => Adn\Gitea\Client::AUTH_TOKEN,
        'auth' => 'your-auth-token'
    ]
);

or

$giteaClient = new Adn\Gitea\Client(
    'https://gitea.yourdomain.com',
    [
        'type' => Adn\Gitea\Client::AUTH_BASIC_AUTH,
        'auth' => [
            'username' => 'your-username',
            'password' => 'your-password',
        ]
    ]
);

// - - - - -

// Get a single repository
$repository = $giteaClient->repositories()->get('owner', 'repoName');

// Get version
$repository = $giteaClient->miscellaneous()->version();
```

Run an API call as another user:

```
// e.g. check subscription status as a user
$status = $giteaClient->sudo('username')->repositories()->checkSubscription();
```
